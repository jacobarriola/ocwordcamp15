#ocwordcamp15 - gulp.js and bower.io theme

This is the OC WordCamp 2015 theme used in my presentation, based on <a href="http://underscores.me/">Underscores</a> and Foundation 5.5.1.

## How to get started
### Prerequisites
* Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/download/" title="Permalink to the Node.js website for download instructions">Node.js</a>
* Install <a href="http://sass-lang.com/install" title="Permalink to the Sass website for install instructions">Sass</a>
* Install Bower - from Terminal or Command Prompt run `npm install --g bower`
* Install Gulp.js - from Terminal or Command Prompt run `npm install --global gulp`

**Note: if you run into errors when using Terminal, you may have to use the sudo command to install Bower or Gulp.js. For instance, `sudo npm install -g bower`**

## Dependencies
### Bower
**Install Foundation using Bower.** We use Bower as our front end package manager. To get started, run `bower install` and all of the packages will be brought into the `.assets/components` directory. We overrode the default `bower_components` directory in `.bowerrc`; all Bower files are sent to `./assets/components`.

### Gulp
The theme dependencies are listed in our `package.json` file. If you run `npm install`, all of the plugin dependencies will be installed into `node_modules`.

Using the `gulpfile.js` file, gulp will handle Sass compiling, vendor-prefixing, CSS minification and browser reloading.  It will automate a lot of tedious tasks for us.  Magic!


Once you’ve adjusted the two strings, from Terminal or Command Prompt run `gulp`.  Gulp will watch your Sass files and will compile when a change is made.  Also, <a href="http://www.browsersync.io/docs/gulp/" title="BrowserSync documentation">BrowserSync</a> will run and inject new CSS after compilation and will reload the browser when your PHP files change.

**CSS Minification** – gulp will compile a minified and non-minified CSS file for you.  The theme will enqueue the non-minified CSS file if `WP_DEBUG` is set to true in the `wp-config.php` file.  It’s generally a good practice to do so anyway when developing themes.

### How to use the Sass files
Using the `_settings.scss` file, you can override a Foundation default style before things get compiled, thereby making your final CSS lighter.  To do so, find the variable in the file, uncomment it, and set the value you desire.  The file is located in `./assets/sass`.

Be sure to check <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/using-sass.html" title="Zurb Foundation documentation on using Sass">Foundation’s docs on using Sass</a> and their mixins for custom control on styles.
